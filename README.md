> A simple TUI using the [ratatui](https://github.com/ratatui-org/ratatui) crate to serve as a front-end to [4at](https://github.com/tsoding/4at)

rat-at-4at is a personal exploration into the world of TUIs, specifically focusing on the [ratatui](https://github.com/ratatui-org/ratatui) crate. This project is born out of a curiosity to experiment with ratatui, which has been on my radar for some time. While [Tsoding](https://www.twitch.tv/tsoding) is developing a client front-end using crossterm directly in the official 4at repo, this repository serves as a separate playground for my experiments with ratatui. I encourage everyone to check out the original code and Tsoding's streams for a deeper understanding of 4at. If you're interested in contributing to this repository, feel free to file an issue or contact me at [danielboll.dev@proton.me](mailto:danielboll.dev@proton.me) for collaboration opportunities.
